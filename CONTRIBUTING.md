## Updating Temporal version

Whenever updating temporal version we might need to update Netty/GRPC GraalVM substitutions and configurations.

Check if `grpc-netty-shaded` Netty version changed, later you would also need to check witch Quarkus version has
the right substitutions, we can do that by checking Quarkus BOM and checking the Netty version.

With the right Quarkus
version we can update the `update-netty-substitutions.sh` file and run it, that script will clone Quarkus repo and update
all Netty/GRPC code needed to run in native mode.
